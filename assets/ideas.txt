#MyTFTMeta.com
- Create a website which takes a username, spiders out to their last 20-50 games (all within same patch) and determines what is the most winningest comp and what items that comp used.
    Note- Could also extend to check last 10 games and the last 10 games of each person in 1st place in each match instead of just the user.
- The website would have a print out with each character portrait and items displayed (depending on assets available in .zip)
- Pull static assets from - http://raw.communitydragon.org/latest/cdragon/tft/en_us.json
- When people pull match history, each matchid gets written to file to work with then can use machine learning on all the txt files later
